# Architecture

Kite's runtime flows through a small set of stages:

```text
session -> context -> provider -> tools -> artifacts -> events -> interfaces
```

Repository linting is a sibling pipeline rather than part of the agent loop:

```text
files -> deterministic checks -> optional Vale -> optional LLM review -> report
```

## Session

A `Session` carries the conversation, the model, and durable state. It is
created with `NewSession(Config)` or loaded with `LoadSession(Config, id)`.
Only one prompt may be active per session; a second `Prompt` call while one is
running returns an error. Runtime failures during a prompt are delivered as
`session.failed` events, not returned from `Prompt`.

## Context

`BuildContext` produces the deterministic context a model sees:

1. Fixed system instructions.
2. The nearest `AGENTS.md` between the working directory and the repository
   root (max 64 KiB), with its absolute source path recorded.
3. Completed messages.
4. Bounded tool previews.

## Provider

The provider streams model replies over SSE. It emits text deltas, completed
tool calls (assembling fragmented calls), usage, and sanitised errors. Wire
types stay private to the provider package.

## Tools

Tools run with repository containment: paths are resolved through symlinks
and rejected if they escape the working directory. Outputs larger than the
inline cap are stored as artifacts.

## Artifacts

Large outputs are stored under the data directory and referenced by a
globally unique ID. The tool result carries a compact preview with the ID,
size, media type, and truncation metadata.

## Events

Every event is durable, sequence-numbered, and persisted before publication.
Consumers receive them on the `Prompt` channel and can replay a session from
its JSONL log.

## Result

When a prompt completes, Kite builds a structured `Result`: status, final
text, files changed during that prompt, verification, and usage.

## Interfaces

The streaming CLI, terminal workspace, Go API, and RPC server are views over
the same session and durable event contracts. `internal/tui` consumes events
from `Session.Prompt`; it neither invokes tools directly nor maintains a second
conversation state. ANSI styling is applied only after model, tool, path, and
error content has been stripped of terminal control bytes.

## Layered lint

`internal/lint` owns an independent `kite.lint/v1` report. Its built-in checks
and optional Vale adapter are deterministic and sorted. The model layer is
bounded, tool-free, path-validated, and advisory by default, so nondeterminism
cannot silently become the repository's required gate.
