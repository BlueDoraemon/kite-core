# Security

Kite is designed with a small, explicit security model.

## Credential handling

- API keys are read from environment variables or `--from-crush`, never
  hard-coded.
- Credentials are never logged.
- Errors are sanitised and secret-free. A provider error never includes the
  API key, OAuth token, or full request body.

## Repository trust

- The nearest `AGENTS.md` between the working directory and repository root is
  loaded, capped at 64 KiB.
- The absolute source path is recorded so instructions are auditable.

## Prompt injection

Repository instructions and tool outputs are treated as untrusted model
input. The fixed system instructions tell the model to work inside the
repository working directory only.

`kite lint -llm` treats selected source as untrusted review input, advertises
no tools, validates returned paths and line numbers, and caps source at 128
KiB. It still sends that source to the configured provider, so enable the
layer only when that provider is permitted to receive it. The deterministic
and Vale layers do not send repository content to a model.

## Shell execution

- Commands run with a 30-second timeout.
- On timeout, the whole process tree is killed (POSIX process groups, Windows
  `taskkill /T`).
- Verification runs are marked with `purpose: "verification"`.

## Filesystem containment

- `read` and `edit` resolve symlinks and reject paths that escape the working
  directory.
- `edit` writes atomically and preserves permissions.
- Bash `working_dir` is resolved through the same containment check.

## Sensitive logs and artifacts

- Artifacts may contain repository content; they are stored with user-only
  permissions.
- Artifact previews are persisted in `artifact.created` and `tool.finished`
  events; full artifact contents are not included in events or errors.
- Session event logs can therefore contain bounded repository-content
  previews and should be treated as sensitive.
- The data directory defaults to user-only XDG/LOCALAPPDATA storage.

## Terminal output

The TUI treats model text, tool input and output, paths, and persisted errors
as untrusted display content. Control bytes are removed before rendering, so
content cannot inject ANSI or OSC commands. `NO_COLOR`, `-plain`, redirected
stdout, and unsupported terminals use the same ledger without ANSI styling.

## Redaction guarantees

- No API keys, OAuth tokens, or credentials in any event, error, log, or RPC
  response.
- Provider HTTP errors include at most 500 bytes of the response body; request
  bodies are not included.
